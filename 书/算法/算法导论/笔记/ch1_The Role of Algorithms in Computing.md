# 1.1 Algorithms
Algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. 
e.g., Input: a sequence of n numbers $(a_{1,}a_{2,}, \cdots, a_n)$
**Output**: a permutation (reording) $<a_1^\prime, a_2^\prime, \cdots, a_n^\prime>$ such that $a_{1}^{\prime} \leq a_{2}^{\prime} \leq \cdots \leq a_{n}^{\prime}$

An algorithm is said to be **correct** if for every input instance, it halts with correct output. 
An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer. **Incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their error rate**.

# 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
Computing power is a bounded resource, and so is space in memory. 
# Efficiency
**insertion sort**: takes time roughly equal to $c_1n^2$ to sort $n$ items: it takes time roughly proportional to $n^2$
**merge sort**: takes time roughly equal to $c_{2}n\times lgn$
## Algorithms and other technologies
Total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware.
